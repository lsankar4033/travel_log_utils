In February/March 2017, I traveled around SE Asia. While traveling, I kept a mailing list as a way to keep in
touch with my close friends back home and practice my writing.

This repo contains adhoc utilities I used for managing this mailing list.

Both tools require installing docopt.

##### TODO
- figure out how to send modified e-mails for batch_send
  - might just be too difficult to warrant writing this tool...
- better README
